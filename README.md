# gProject

This is my readme file for this project.  

I have a good idea maybe of what to make for a project for this class.  

But just in case, Let's make sure the idea is good.  

I want to build a game chooser for our expansive board game library. The game chooser should include the following ways to filter:
* by genre
* by length of time
* by number of players it's best at


## About Me

![Picture of me drawing](http://mousewax.com/MeDrawing.png)

I am a cartoonist. You can view <a href="http://www.mousewax.com">my **lame comic here**</a>. But be careful, I did draw a picture of Muhammed.

There's a lot I could probably say here, but I want to keep it short and sweet.

From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atena_Farghadani">*Wikipedia*</a>:
Atena Farghadani is an Iranian artist and political activist, who was imprisoned for 18 months. Amnesty International considers her a prisoner of conscience. She was released on 3 May 2016.

One of her cartoons, in which she criticized a draft law which would outlaw voluntary sterilisation and restrict access to measures of birth control, portrayed Iranian government officials as monkeys and goats.

In September 2015, Farghadani was charged with an "illegitimate sexual relationship short of adultery" and "indecent conduct" after shaking the hand of her lawyer Mohammad Moghimi, who visited her in prison after her trial.

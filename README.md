# gProject

This is my readme file for this project.  

I have a good idea maybe of what to make for a project for this class.  

But just in case, Let's make sure the idea is good.  

I want to build a game chooser for our expansive board game library. The came should include the following ways to filter:
* by genre
* by length of time
* by number of players it's best at
